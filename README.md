## Description

Recently, my dad scanned in a lot of old family photos from as early as the 1930s. He has the photos stored on a hard drive and does not want them to be pulled from the cloud. The application works through relative directories, so he can host the site and server from his home. Traced will be able to be shared to family members who can create accounts and view photos. Admin accounts can create, edit, and delete photos to keep the database as clean as possible.
